Here comes the first post of our home automaton project website.

Our project aims at designing an open-source versatile home automaton system. It is written in Python and can run on any Python-capable device. 

This website has a couple of goals:

- promote our project to the world
- easily post project's progress via the [project log][log]
- explain our design choices in the [project wiki][wiki]
- make a [documentation][doc] available to everyone willing to use our project.
