<h1>RVVDomoticBox</h1>
The RVVDomoticBox project is led by three engineering students in the French Grande Ecole Sup√©lec.
It aims at designing a versatile home automaton manager using Python.
Its main characteristics are the following :


- open-source: we wish anybody to be able use what we develop 
- modularity: the whole app is plugin-based, making it really easy to enhance the base system
- simplicity: the choice of Python as a programming language and the relative simplicity of the software architecture should let anyone develop plugins
